    <p>When I think of the perfect coffee spot, 'Camel Step' is the first name that pops into my head.</p>

        <span>here are some of the reasons why it's my favorite: </span>
        <ul>
            <li>Incredible coffee</li>
            <li>Great staff</li>
            <li>High-quality coffee tools</li>
            <li>Creative branding and logo</li>
            <li>Beautiful interior</li>

        <h3 id = "drinks">What to Order?</h3>
        Camel Step offers a wide range of options, especially when it comes to espresso drinks, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Espresso (obviously)</li>
                <li>Flat White</li>
                <li>Latte</li>
                <li>Cortado and more</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            However, if espresso drinks aren't your thing, Camel Step also serves the best drip coffee, <br>
            including:
            <ul>
                <li>Coffee of the day</li>
                <li>V60</li>
                <li>Nitro Cold Brew</li>
            </ul>
            Personally, the iced V60 is my favorite. It has the perfect ice-to-coffee ratio,
            <br> and they’re consistently great with it. But if you’re not a fan of the strong V60 taste,
            <br> their coffee of the day won't disappoint.
